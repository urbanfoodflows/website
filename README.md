This repository contains the source code of [The Urban Food Flows website](https://urbanfoodflows.net). This website provides a data visualization tool for urban food flow datasets. By collating the data in a user-friendly (spreadsheet) format, anyone can develop a data dashboard for their city.

The following technologies are used:

- Django 5
- Python 3
- PostgreSQL 
- Docker

If you are able to assist as a designer or front-end developer with the visual elements of our website then please get in touch!

The Urban Food Flows website is currently unavailable to the public, until the papers that describe the datasets that are being presented on the website have been published.
