This repository contains the source code of [The Urban Food Flows website](https://urbanfoodflows.net). This website provides a data visualization tool for urban food flow datasets. By collating the data in a user-friendly (spreadsheet) format, anyone can develop a data dashboard for their city.

The following technologies are used:

- Django
- PostgreSQL 
- Docker
- Apache ECharts
- Google Charts

If you are able to assist as a designer or front-end developer with the visual elements of our website then please get in touch! We also welcome people that want to suggest new features or report bugs - feel free to use Github to [report new issues](https://github.com/urbanfoodflows/website/issues) or [contact us](https://urbanfoodflows.net/about/).

In order to draw more attention to urban food flows, we developed this online, open source data dashboard that presents visualizations of different food systems. This work accompanies the following paper:

[Data requirements for a systematic analysis of urban food flows and their sustainability outcomes](https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083241298431), *Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science* (2024).  L. Guibrunet, P. Hoekman, A. Bortolotti, J. Battersby-Lennard.
